This tool is ported from the *Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary 8th Edition*'s CD-ROM to *OALD 9th Edition* in HTML format. It is also available for premium users on the **Oxford Learner's Dictionaries** website, however, it was deprecated on Dec 31, 2020 in favor of new design.

This reposity is created to preserve this version, which works independently without relying on the **Oxford Learner's Dictionaries** website's resources. The new design, however, requires online server to function.

## Features
- Rewritten from the ground up, powered by React.
- Revamped layout.
- Navigate Model text, Step-by-step (formerly Guided tour) and Practice writing (formerly My writing) in one place. Switch back and forth for ease of checking/writing. No more unnecessary dialogs or menus.
- Support light and dark modes.

## Browser compatibility
Work on the latest version of the following browsers:
- Chromium browsers (Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Opera, Brave, ...)
- Mozilla Firefox (in Private Browsing there're some issues)
- Safari (macOS, iOS, iPadOS)

## Run the tool offline
Download this repository (or clone it) on your hard drive. Then use Python and create a local server `python -m http.server` to access it.

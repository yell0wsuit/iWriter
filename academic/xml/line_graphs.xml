   <framework_title>Presenting Data: line graphs</framework_title>
   <framework_intro>
      <para>Here is a framework to help you present data effectively using a line graph. This framework first gives statements summarizing what the line graph is going to be about; then commentary based on the line graph; and, finally, the line graph itself with a title.<br />There are spaces for you to add your own text and graph.</para>

            <para>One of the main ways you can present your data effectively is to use visuals. Visuals summarize your data and make it easy for readers to understand what has been found in your research.</para>

            <para>This is an extract from the ‘International Journal of Epidemiology’. It looks at social disparities in BMI trajectories and uses a line graph to convey findings.

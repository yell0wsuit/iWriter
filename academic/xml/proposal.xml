         <commentary>
            <para>The aim of the research proposal is to present your proposed research clearly and concisely so that institutions can assess whether they will be able to supervise your research, or—for undergraduates—to show that you have carefully planned the research project for your dissertation.</para>

         <commentary>
            <para>It is essential for you to show that you understand the field and the focus of your research. The core sections of the research proposal are (1) the literature review, (2) the aims or research questions, and (3) the data and methodology. You will also need to include (4) limitations and (5) contribution of the study. Each of these sections will shed light on how your research will make an original contribution to the field.</para>

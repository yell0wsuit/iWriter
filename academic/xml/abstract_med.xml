   <framework_title>Writing an Abstract 3: medicine</framework_title>
   <framework_intro>
      <para>Here is a plan to help you write an abstract. Abstracts in medicine and health science have a combination of up to five moves. It is common in these disciplines to structure the abstract with headings such as 'Background', 'Methods', 'Results' and 'Conclusion'.<br />There are spaces for you to add the content of your abstract.</para>

   <framework_intro>
      <para>Here is a plan to help you write an abstract. Abstracts in the physical and life sciences usually have a combination of four moves.<br />There are spaces for you to add the content of your abstract.</para>

         <commentary>
            <para>The abstract occurs at the beginning of your dissertation or thesis. The main aim of the abstract is to provide the reader with a summary of your research.</para>
            <para>The abstract is usually written at the end of the research process, and after writing the rest of the dissertation.</para>

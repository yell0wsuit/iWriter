            <commentary>
                <para>A covering letter (&#60;i&#62;NAmE&#60;/i&#62; cover letter) accompanies a CV/résumé or an application form. It can be a letter, an email, or part of an online form, but the content and language will be essentially the same. In Britain and North America they are usually typed on a single page. A good letter uses formal language and presents some key arguments for why you are a strong candidate. This is achieved by relating your skills and experience to the requirements of the job being applied for.</para>

            <para><![CDATA[]]>Method sections in dissertations in any discipline will usually have a combination of three purposes. A method section aims to:</para>
            <para><![CDATA[]]>1. describe the data and method used;</para>
            <para><![CDATA[]]>2. explain how the data were collected and how the method(s) were employed in the research; and</para>

            <para><![CDATA[]]></para>
            <para><![CDATA[]]>Method sections in different disciplines differ in terms of the emphasis they place on the different purposes. Humanities and social science disciplines tend to favour a more extended discussion of the explanations and justifications of how and why things were done. Whatever the discipline, the primary goal of the method section is to convey to the readers the validity of the research you have undertaken.</para>

This is particularly true of methods that involve a survey as there are a number of issues which need to be taken into account—for example, the sampling technique, the representativeness of the sample, the variables involved, and the questions posed in the survey.</para>

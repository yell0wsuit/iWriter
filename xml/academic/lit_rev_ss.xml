            <para><![CDATA[]]>A literature review is a section in a piece of research writing which describes the existing work that has been done on the writer's research topic and related areas.</para>

      <step label="What is its purpose?">
         <commentary>
            <para><![CDATA[]]>The purpose of the literature review is to set the new work in the context of what has already been done on the topic, showing the reader how the new research fits into the field and how it builds on and extends what is already known about the topic. By describing the research already done, the writer can point out what has not been done, or what is being challenged, and demonstrate the need for the new research. In this sense, the review helps accomplish the objectives (‘moves’ and ‘steps’) in the introduction. In fact, the literature review may be part of the introduction, although in some research texts—particularly dissertations—it may occupy a separate section.</para>

      <step label="How is it organized?">
         <commentary>

            <para><![CDATA[]]>The Literature Review is often written in paragraphs which move from a general statement about the broad research topic, through gradually more specific aspects of the research. A gap in, or a problem with, the existing research is then shown, leading to a statement of the aim of the current study.</para>

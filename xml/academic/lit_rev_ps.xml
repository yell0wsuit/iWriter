            <para><![CDATA[]]>The purpose of the literature review is to show the reader how the new research fits into the field and how it builds on and extends what is already known about the topic. By describing the research already done, the writer can point out what has not been done, and demonstrate the need for the new research. In this sense, the review helps accomplish the objectives (‘moves’ and ‘steps’) in the introduction. In fact, the literature review may be part of the introduction, although in some research texts—particularly dissertations—it may occupy a separate section.</para>

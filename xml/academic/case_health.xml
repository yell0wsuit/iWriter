            <para><![CDATA[]]>Case studies are widely used in the health sciences. The case presentation invariably relates to a real-life patient and typically contains the presenting features and the relevant medical/social/family history, along with investigations, treatment and follow-up.</para>

         <commentary>
            <para><![CDATA[]]>The primary aim of case studies in the health field generally is the identification and definition of a problem followed by recommendations. However, different areas of the health sciences may have different aims, such as: proposing a plan of action or a care treatment plan, or suggesting interventions. There may also be more reflective practice in some case studies than others.</para>

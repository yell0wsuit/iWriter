                    <extra_info eid="29">Despite these similarities,</extra_info> there are a number of significant differences between the two types of course. The main advantage of online courses is that students have continuous access to the learning material, and learning can be done anywhere at any time. On the other hand, face-to-face learning happens only in the classroom according to a fixed timetable. This is a disadvantage for students who also have to work and for students who live far away from the college or school.

					Unlike traditional courses, which require buildings and teachers, online courses only need a website and digital learning materials. Added to this, online courses can take an almost unlimited number of students, while traditional courses are limited to the number of people that can fit into a lecture hall. The end result is that online courses are much cheaper, and in some cases, free.

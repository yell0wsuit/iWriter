                <para>A report describes a study, an investigation or a project. Its purpose is to provide recommendations or updates, and sometimes to persuade readers to accept an idea. It is written by a single person or a group who has investigated the issue. It is read by people who require the information.</para>

Among <useful type="key" eid="23">the most popular reasons cited</useful> for visiting Lakewater in preference to the town centre were the ample free parking there compared with the difficulties of parking in the town centre and the convenience of having a large number of stores in one location in the mall. Families, in particular, mentioned the Lakewater children's play area as an important advantage.

Parking problems in the town centre have been <useful type="key" eid="34">a significant factor</useful> in changing people's habits. Mobile, better-off consumers are deserting the high street for the new mall, leaving the town-centre traders relying on the custom of local residents, particularly the elderly and those without cars. <useful type="key" eid="35">As a result</useful>, many long-established businesses now face grave difficulties.</para>
